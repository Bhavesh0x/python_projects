🧠 AI Virtual Mouse

The AI Virtual Mouse is a computer vision project that allows users to control their system cursor using hand gestures captured through a webcam.
It uses OpenCV for image processing and MediaPipe for real-time hand tracking, replacing traditional mouse inputs with gesture-based control.

This project demonstrates how AI and Computer Vision can enhance Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) through touchless control systems.

⚙ Features
	•	🖐 Real-time hand detection and tracking
	•	🖱 Perform mouse movements, clicks, and drags using gestures
	•	⚡ Built using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe
	•	🧩 Modular structure for easy customization
	•	💡 Ideal for learning AI, machine learning, and vision-based interfaces

🎯 Objective

Developed as a student project to explore practical applications of AI and Computer Vision, this system bridges theoretical knowledge with real-world implementation.
It highlights how gesture-based systems can improve accessibility, creativity, and user interaction in modern computing.

🚀 Future Enhancements
	•	Add multi-hand gesture recognition
	•	Improve tracking accuracy and smoothness
	•	Integrate voice commands or keyboard shortcuts
	•	Explore virtual presentation controls or gaming applications

🧩 Technologies Used
	•	Programming Language: Python
	•	Libraries: OpenCV, MediaPipe, NumPy
	•	Tools: PyCharm / VS Code, Git, Webcam
